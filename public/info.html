			<p1><a herf="https://www.joincyberdiscovery.com/">Cyber discovery</a> is a goverment endorsed program that is designed to engage school children from years 10-13 into the world of cyber defence.  It is a four stage program currently being in its first.  Due to the time between the first and second stage the <a href="https://discord.gg/8h7HU4C">Cyber Discovery Unofficial Discord</a> was created and players joined creating their own challenges and even completing some additional ones from Cyber Discovery staff.  This is why I created Challenge Master as a unified place to host these challenges and to also add to the competition by implementing a scoring system that allows points to be awarded even when the challenge host is offline.</p1></div>

			<H2>Rules:</H2>
			<p1>The rules are simple DO NOT CHEAT and if you find a way to cheat report it responsibly.  Cheating in any of form will result in a ban.<br>A non exclusive list of cheating methods: 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Creating Multiple Accounts</b> to gain score.</li>
					<li><b>Creating challeges that do not actually lead to the given solution.</b></li>
					<li><b>Telling people the accepted solution</b> to a challenge, although hints are fine</li>
				</ul>
				<br>Points are awarded as follows:
				<ul>
					<li><b>10 Points</b> are awarded to the <b>first person to solve a challenge.</b></li>
					<li><b>5 Points</b> are awarded to any user who <b>reports a security vulnerbility in the website, see info.</b> - I reserve the right to decide what counts as "a security vulnerbility"</li>
					<li><b>2 Points</b> are awarded to users who solve a challenge but <b>are not the first to do so.</b></li>
					<li><b>1 Point</b> is awarded a user who <b>created a challenge when it is solved for the first time.</b></li>
					<li>I reserve the right to award and revoke score, however I will disclose when this happens</li>
				</ul></p1></div>

			<H2>Bug Bounty:</H2>
			<p1>As seen above one way of earning points is by disclosing security flaws in the website to me.  This is to be done <b>via discord DM's</b> and you are <b>not allowed</b> to discuss the nature of the flaw until I tell you that it has been fixed.  I will decide whether your security flaw is worthy of score on a case by case basis. However, I will not award points for showing me that the site can be DDOSed so please do not do this as if I go over a traffic limit the site will shutdown.  Additonally, do not attempt to mess with the site in a manor that will effect the end users experiance.  Finally, as well as being rewarded with score your name will be put into the <b>White Page of Fame</b> where you will be regarded as a demi-god second to only the <a href="http://www.jameslyne.com/photo-large-square.jpg" style="text-decoration:none">saviour himself</a>.</p1></div>
